## Abstract  
The 21 st Century is witnessing a rapid rise of urbanization both in the developed and the
developing world. Cities increasingly need to be able to do more with less in order to provide for
the well-being of their citizens in a sustainable way. The promise of Smart City is an emerging
ability to understand, to respond to, and to shape human activity at urban population and
geographic scales so that a more agile, adaptive, and sustainable urban environment can be
created (see Batty et al., 2012; Caragliu et al., 2011; Chourabi et al., 2012; Su et al., 2011 for
early adoption of Smart City). To be effective, this requires the predictive power of data-driven
modelling and city-scale computational simulations. Recently city-scale simulations are becoming
possible thanks to a surge of development in the high-performance computing (HPC) domain
including advanced hardware, computational and algorithmic techniques such as domain
decomposition across multi-GPUs and multigrid techniques. Advanced high performance
computing systems (a billion billion calculations per second) are now becoming available to
performance city-scale simulations with micro-scale models of an individual objective (structure,
people, vehicle, etc.) (e.g. SÃ¡nchez-Medina et al., 2010; Hori, 2011; Zia et al., 2012; Wijerathne
et al., 2013; Pijanowski et al., 2014; Yoshimura et al., 2016; Johansen et al., 2017; Lu and Guan.,
2017)
